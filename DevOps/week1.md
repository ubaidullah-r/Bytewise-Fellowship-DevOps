# What  is Devops ?

Devops is comprise of cultural principles, methods and tools to achieve rapid development and deployment of software product and services through collaboration between development and operations which are no longer isolated but merged into one team, where automation plays a vital role.

# Breif History Of DevOps
DevOps has its roots in the Agile software development movement, which emphasised the value of collaboration, customer involvement, and flexibility in software development. While Agile was primarily concerned with the development process, DevOps expanded this focus to include the entire software delivery pipeline, from development to testing to deployment and beyond.

Patrick Debois, a Belgian software developer who organised the inaugural DevOpsDays conference in Ghent, Belgium, invented the phrase "DevOps" in 2009. The conference brought together developers, operations professionals, and other stakeholders to discuss the emerging DevOps movement and share ideas and practises.
DevOps is already a mature and widely used approach, with many organisations benefiting from faster, more dependable, and efficient software delivery. DevOps, on the other hand,is always changing, with new technologies, processes, and trends developing to solve the continuous problems of software development and delivery in an ever-changing world.

DevOps nowadays is  mature and widely used approach, with many organisations benefiting from faster, more dependable, and efficient software delivery. The DevOps landscape, on the other hand, is always evolving, with new technologies, methods, and trends developing to solve the continuous difficulties of software development and delivery in a quickly changing world.





# What is DevOps Culture

The values, principles, and behaviours that form the foundation of the DevOps approach are referred to as the DevOps culture. DevOps culture is fundamentally focused on teamwork, communication, and ongoing development. Some of the fundamental ideas that constitute the DevOps culture include the following:

## Collaboration: 

To encourage shared ownership of the software development process, DevOps emphasises the significance of collaboration between the development and operations teams.

## Continuous improvement:

It is a goal of DevOps teams, who constantly look for ways to enhance their procedures and methods. Metrics and user input are used to gauge success and pinpoint areas for development.

## Automation: 

To increase productivity and decrease errors, the DevOps culture strongly emphasises automating repetitive operations and procedures.

## Agility: 

DevOps teams prioritise the capacity to quickly adapt to changing requirements and market situations, placing a high priority on agility and flexibility.

# What are Software Development Lifecycle Models ?

SDLC models are frameworks or processes for planning, designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. SDLC models offer an organised approach to software development by leading the development team through the various stages of the software development process.
There are various SDLC models. Some of the most popular SDLC models are as follows:

## The Waterfall Model:

It is a systematic, linear approach to software development that includes numerous separate phases such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

## Agile Model: 

The Agile Model is a method of software development that is iterative and incremental, emphasising flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It entails breaking down the software development process into smaller iterations or sprints, each with its own set of planning, design, programming, testing, and review.

## Spiral Model: 

The Spiral Model is a risk-driven approach to software development that involves iteratively repeating a cycle of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. Before going on to the next iteration of the Spiral Model, each iteration includes constructing and testing a small piece of software.

# What is Difference Between Waterfall And Agile Model ?

| Waterall  | Agile |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Waterfall is a sequential, linear approach to software development in which each phase (such as requirements gathering, design, programming, testing, and deployment) is accomplished one at a time and in sequence. | Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative, incremental approach to software development that divides work into smaller iterations or sprints that involve planning, design, development, testing, and review  |
| Waterfall is a more rigid method to software development that leaves minimal room for adjustments or revisions once a phase is completed.  | Agile, is more adaptable and responsive to change, allowing development teams to shift their approach in response to feedback and changing requirements.  |
| Waterfall development entails less direct client participation throughout the development process due to its sequential nature, with requirements obtained beforehand and then delivered at the conclusion of the project. | Agile emphasises customer interaction and collaboration throughout the development process, with regular feedback and evaluations |
| Testing occurs at the end of the development phase, after the software has been constructed, in Waterfall | Testing is integrated throughout the development process in Agile, with ongoing testing and feedback to guarantee that the programme meets the needs of the customers. |
